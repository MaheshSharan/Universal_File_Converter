Would you like me to start implementing these changes? I'll begin with:

Format validation and conversion dropdown updates
Server-side conversion improvements
Download functionality with zip support

Next steps:

Test the conversion functionality with various file formats
Implement format validation on the client side
Add error recovery mechanisms
Implement file cleanup on the server

Implement multi-file conversion
dont change any ui or ux keep that in mind , and if multiple files of same format got upload and now user slected a desired format to convert them , dont do like for each file we have to specify the format keep a command desired format drop downn , and keep a common convert button for all multiple file , you rember the upload rules i told about right ? keep them in mind . now when user click on convert , dont keep progress bar common for all files . keep that sepearte for each file , but keep dowload button common for all files , while downloading each file queue by queue , whichever file is downloading show loader next right to it  and purlpe tick on success , add a 3 dot icon on its right side  too , on clicking it show "Only Download this particualr file " , on clicking it only download that specific file . lese download all , did you got what i said , dont change any ui keep that in mind 

kindly do them all smoothly and properly , keep in mind dont change any other functionality or auth thing , just fix and implment multiple conversion thing and dwonload thing
